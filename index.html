				<h2>Prayer</h2>
				<p style="text-align:center;text-indent:0;">The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want.<br>He makes me down to lie in pastures green; he leadeth me the quiet waters by.<br>My soul he doth restore again, and me to walk doth make witithin the paths of righteousness, e'en for his own name's sake.<br>Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,<br>yet will I fear none ill, for thou art with me and thy rod and staff me comfort still.<br>My table thou hast furnished in presence of my foes.<br>My head thou dost with oil annoint, and my cup overflows.<br>Goodness and mercy all my life shall surely follow me, and in God's house forevermore my dwelling place shall be.</p>

				<h2>I Stand All Amazed</h2>
				<p style="text-align:center;text-indent:0;">&#127925; I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me.<br>Confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me.<br>I tremble to know that for me he was crucified.<br>That for me, a sinner, he suffered, he bled and died.<br>Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me<br>Enough to die for me!<br>Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!<br>I marvel that he would descend from his throne divine<br>To rescue a soul so rebllious and proud as mine,<br>That he should extend his great love unto such as I.<br>Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.<br>Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me<br>Enough to die for me!<br>Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!<br>I think of his hands pierced and bleeding to pay the debt!<br>Such mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?<br>No, no, I will praise and adore at the mery seat,<br>Until at the glorified throne I kneel at his feet.<br>Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me<br>Enough to die for me!<br>Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me! &#127925;</p>

				<h2>Because I Have Been Given Much</h2>
				<p style="text-align:center;text-indent:0;">&#127925; Because I have been given much, I too must give.<br>Because of thy great bounty Lord, each day I live.<br>I shall divide my gifts from thee<br>With every brother that I see<br>Who has the need of help from me.<br><br>Because I have been sheltered, fed by thy good care;<br>I cannot see another's lack and I not share;<br>My glowing fire, my loaf of bread,<br>My roof's safe shelter overhead<br>That he too may be comforted.<br><br>Because I have been blessed by thy great love dear Lord;<br>I'll share thy love again according to thy word;<br>I shall give love to those in need,<br>I'll show that love by word and deed;<br>Thus shall my thanks be thanks in deed. &#127925;</p>

				<h2>How Great Thou Art</h2>
				<p style="text-align:center;text-indent:0;">&#127925; O LORD my God! When I in awesome wonder<br>Consider all the works Thy hand hath made;<br>I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder,<br><br>Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,<br>How great Thou art! How great Thou art!<br>Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,<br>How great Thou art! How great Thou art!<br><br>When through the woods and forest glades I wander<br>And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;<br>When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,<br>And hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze;<br><br>Then sings my soul, my Saviour god, to Thee,<br>How great Thou art! How great Thou art!<br>Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,<br>How great Thou art! How great Thou art!<br><br>And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,<br>Sent Him to die - I scarce can take it in:<br>That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,<br>He bled and died to take away my sin:<br><br>Then sings my soul, my Saviour god, to Thee,<br>How great Thou art! How great Thou art!<br>Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,<br>How great Thou art! How great Thou art!<br><br>When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation<br>And take me home - what joy shall fill my heart!<br>Then shall I bow in humble adoration,<br>And there proclaim, my God how great Thou art! &#127925;</p>
